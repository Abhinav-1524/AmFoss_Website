    The club’s story starts when its founder, Mr. Vipin Pavithran, who worked in the US,
    for over 10 years experienced in software engineering joined Amrita University in 2006.

    “One of the vivid memories that I have of my bachelors was lack of support from the institution. I
    know the value of right guidance at the right time and how it can make a huge impact. This
    made me want to help any one who needed guidance.”

    He quickly realised that the students here had little focus, confidence and exposure to
    take on the real world, due to the absence of proper mentoring and support.

    In the summer of 2006, he was approached by Abhilash T G seeking mentoring to participate in the
    IBM Great Mind Challenge 2006. Soon a team of enthusiasts was formed, and rigorous preparation had
    started. Initially, the students were not really confident of getting selected let alone winning.
    However, they were highly motivated and enthusiastic about it. While at the same time, Vipin was however,
    very confident in his students, and having prior experience in software development was certain
    that his students would come on top.
